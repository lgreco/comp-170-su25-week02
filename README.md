# COMP 170 week 02

For this week's assignment focus on last week's reading assignment and work on the following items.

## Function to greet a person

Write a function named `greet` that takes one argument, say `name`, and **returns** a greeting string. For example, `greet("Thomas")` should **return** the string:
```
Hello Thomas. How are you?
```

## Greet a few friends

Create a simple list (not a dictionary) with the names of some friends. For example:
```python
my_friends = ["Frodo", "Sam", "Gandalf"]
```
Then write a function that takes the list of friends and **prints** a greeting for every one of them using function `greet(name)` from earlier.

## Solve an equation

$$x$$
